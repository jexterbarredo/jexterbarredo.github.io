<p class="justified">Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars beyond our own Sun. The first confirmed discovery of an exoplanet came in 1992, and since then, astronomers have identified thousands more using space telescopes like Kepler and TESS. These planets vary greatly in size, composition, and orbital patterns—some are scorching gas giants hugging tightly to their stars, while others are rocky Earth-like worlds in more distant orbits. The study of exoplanets is important because it deepens our understanding of planetary systems and helps answer one of humanity’s biggest questions: are we alone in the universe? By analyzing their atmospheres, temperatures, and compositions, scientists hope to identify planets that could support life. Discovering habitable exoplanets also influences theories about how planets form, migrate, and evolve in different star systems. One remarkable example is Kepler-452b, a super-Earth located in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star about 1,400 light-years away. Although it’s larger than Earth, it receives similar levels of sunlight and has a year roughly the same length. Such discoveries ignite imagination and research, fueling the possibility that distant planets may one day be explored—or even visited—by future generations..</p>
