<p class="justified">Nebulae are massive clouds of gas and dust in space, often spanning light-years across. They are commonly known as the "nurseries" of stars because this is where new stars are born. Some nebulae glow with vibrant colors due to the radiation from nearby stars, while others appear dark as they block the light behind them.

Nebulae are important because they are a key part of the life cycle of stars. When a star is formed, it comes from the dense regions of a nebula. Similarly, when massive stars die in a supernova explosion, they can create new nebulae, spreading elements like hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen into space, which will eventually help form new stars and planets.

By studying nebulae, scientists can learn more about how stars and planetary systems like our own come into existence. Nebulae also help us understand the complex interactions between gravity, radiation, and matter in the universe. Their stunning appearance and scientific value make them one of the most fascinating objects in astronomy.</p>
